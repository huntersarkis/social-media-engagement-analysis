# Social Media Engagement Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes social media engagement trends across multiple platforms using a dataset of viral social media posts. The goal of the analysis is to understand how engagement varies by platform, hashtag, and geographic region.

The dataset includes metrics such as views, likes, shares, and comments from several social media platforms.

## Dataset
Source: Kaggle – Viral Social Media Trends Dataset

The dataset includes the following fields:

- Platform
- Hashtag
- Content Type
- Region
- Views
- Likes
- Shares
- Comments

---

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SQL
- Jupyter Notebook

## Data Preparation
An engagement metric was created to measure total interaction per post.

```
Engagement = Likes + Shares + Comments
```

This metric was used to analyze how audiences interact with content across different platforms and topics.

- **Twitter (~386.0M)** had the lowest engagement among the four platforms.

### Engagement by Hashtag
- **#Education (~176.8M)** and **#Fitness (~176.3M)** produced the highest engagement.
- **#Comedy (~165.6M)** and **#Tech (~164.2M)** also performed strongly.
- **#Gaming (~153.0M)** had the lowest engagement in the dataset.

### Engagement by Region

    SUM(Likes + Shares + Comments) AS Total_Engagement
FROM social_media_engagement
GROUP BY Platform
ORDER BY Total_Engagement DESC;
```
